# Nash Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

## Description: This is the official codebase for Nash CoT


## What's CoT

(If you have no related-background knowledge about CoT, please read these papers [1,2,3] first) CoT is a *step-by-step* manner inference approach. This approach is composed of two steps. Step1: Generating rationals 


Here, we provide single case for CoT:
